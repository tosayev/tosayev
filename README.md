#Kazim Tosayev
I am a ship-repair expert with a degree in naval architecture & marine engineering from the University of Michigan. I have been traversing the shipping sector from an incredibly early age and now I am working as a superintendent for a fleet of tankers (oil, chemical, LPG) and tugboats. I have expertise in survey & inspection, technical management, fleet maintenance, project management, with a verifiable record of maintaining, repairing, coordinating large-scale new builds, drydocks, and repair/maintenance projects.

I fell in love with coding from the very first day of my Engineering 101 class at the University of Michigan with the late, beloved, Prof. Jason Daida.

I'm currently learning Python, Solidity, Blockchain Development.
